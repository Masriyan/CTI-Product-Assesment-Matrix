# Symantec/Broadcom Threat Intelligence

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Broadcom Inc. (Symantec Enterprise Division)
**Headquarters:** San Jose, California, USA
**Founded:** 1982 (Symantec); Acquired by Broadcom 2019
**Website:** https://www.broadcom.com/products/cybersecurity

Symantec Threat Intelligence, now part of Broadcom's enterprise security division following the $10.7 billion acquisition in 2019, represents one of the world's most established cybersecurity intelligence operations with over four decades of threat research heritage. Leveraging the Global Intelligence Network (GIN) with telemetry from 175+ million endpoints across 157 countries, Symantec processes massive daily threat data to deliver intelligence through its DeepSight platform and integrated security portfolio. Unlike newer cloud-native competitors, Symantec's strength lies in its unparalleled historical threat data, extensive email threat intelligence from decades of anti-spam operations, and comprehensive web reputation database (WebPulse) used by millions globally. The Advanced Threat Research (ATR) team continues Symantec's legacy of in-depth malware analysis, targeted attack research, and vulnerability intelligence. While the Broadcom acquisition has brought organizational changes and some product rationalization, the core intelligence capabilities remain robust, particularly for enterprises with existing Symantec/Broadcom security investments across endpoint protection (Symantec Endpoint Security), email security, DLP, and the Integrated Cyber Defense (ICD) platform. The intelligence focus spans commodity malware to sophisticated APTs, with particular strength in email-based threats, file reputation, and web security intelligence.
