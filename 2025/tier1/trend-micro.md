# Trend Micro Threat Intelligence

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Trend Micro Incorporated
**Headquarters:** Tokyo, Japan / Irving, Texas, USA
**Founded:** 1988
**Website:** https://www.trendmicro.com/

Trend Micro delivers threat intelligence through its Smart Protection Network (SPN), one of the world's most advanced cloud-based security infrastructure systems processing over 500 billion queries daily from more than 500 million endpoints, mobile devices, and network sensors globally. With over 35 years of cybersecurity expertise and significant presence across Asia-Pacific, North America, Europe, and Latin America, Trend Micro provides comprehensive threat intelligence powered by its global network of threat research centers and the renowned Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) vulnerability research program—the industry's largest vendor-agnostic bug bounty program. The intelligence spans traditional endpoint and network threats to emerging attack surfaces including cloud workloads, containers, industrial IoT, and OT/ICS environments. Trend Micro's Vision One XDR platform unifies threat intelligence across endpoint (Apex One), network (TippingPoint), email (Cloud App Security), server (Deep Security/Cloud One), and mobile security, enabling automated correlation and response. The company's strong APAC regional presence provides unique visibility into regional threat actors and campaigns targeting Asian markets while maintaining global threat coverage.
