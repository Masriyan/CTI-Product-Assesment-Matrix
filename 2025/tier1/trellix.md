# Trellix Threat Intelligence

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Trellix (Musarubra US LLC - Symphony Technology Group)
**Headquarters:** San Jose, California, USA (formerly Santa Clara)
**Founded:** 2022 (merger of McAfee Enterprise and FireEye Products)
**Website:** https://www.trellix.com/

Trellix represents the ambitious merger of two cybersecurity giants: McAfee Enterprise's endpoint security heritage and FireEye Products' network security and threat intelligence expertise. Following Symphony Technology Group's $4 billion acquisition of McAfee Enterprise from McAfee Corp in 2021 and subsequent $1.2 billion merger with FireEye Products (excluding Mandiant) in 2022, Trellix combines decades of threat intelligence from over 1 billion endpoints and sensors worldwide. The platform delivers threat intelligence powered by the Advanced Research Center (formerly McAfee Labs and FireEye research teams), processing massive telemetry from endpoint, network, email, and cloud security deployments. Unlike the Mandiant intelligence operation (sold to Google), Trellix focuses on operationalizing threat intelligence through its XDR platform, integrating detection content, IOCs, and automation across endpoint (Trellix Endpoint Security/EDR), network (Trellix Network Security), email (Trellix Email Security), and cloud security. The intelligence is distributed through the Trellix Data Exchange Layer (DXL) enabling real-time threat sharing across the security ecosystem. While the merger created some platform complexity, it also unified massive threat visibility with automated response capabilities.
