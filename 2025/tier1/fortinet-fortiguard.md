# Fortinet FortiGuard Threat Intelligence

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Fortinet, Inc.
**Headquarters:** Sunnyvale, California, USA
**Founded:** 2000 (FortiGuard Labs established 2002)
**Website:** https://www.fortiguard.com/

FortiGuard Labs is Fortinet's global threat intelligence and research organization, comprising over 500 cybersecurity experts and data scientists who protect more than 700,000 organizations worldwide. Leveraging telemetry from millions of deployed Fortinet devices across the Security Fabric, FortiGuard processes billions of threat events daily to deliver real-time intelligence, security ratings, and automated threat prevention. Unlike standalone threat intelligence platforms, FortiGuard intelligence is deeply woven into every component of the Fortinet Security Fabric—from FortiGate next-generation firewalls to FortiClient endpoint protection, FortiMail email security, FortiWeb application firewalls, and FortiSASE cloud security. What distinguishes FortiGuard is its exceptionally fast signature update cycles (often within minutes of threat discovery), comprehensive coverage across network, endpoint, email, web, and cloud attack surfaces, and automatic enforcement across the entire Security Fabric. The organization provides some of the industry's most extensive web filtering and URL categorization databases, botnet command-and-control tracking, and IPS signature coverage while maintaining accessibility for organizations of all sizes.
