# Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Microsoft Corporation
**Headquarters:** Redmond, Washington, USA
**Founded:** 1975 (Defender TI launched 2022, formerly RiskIQ acquired 2021)
**Website:** https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/threat-intelligence/

Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (formerly RiskIQ) represents Microsoft's comprehensive threat intelligence offering, built on the foundation of RiskIQ's attack surface management expertise combined with Microsoft's unparalleled global telemetry. Drawing insights from trillions of signals daily across Windows endpoints, Microsoft 365, Azure cloud services, and Xbox gaming platforms, Defender TI provides organizations with threat intelligence at unprecedented scale. The platform excels in attack surface discovery, infrastructure intelligence (WHOIS, DNS, SSL certificates), and adversary tracking. What distinguishes Defender TI is its deep integration into the broader Microsoft Security ecosystem, particularly Microsoft Sentinel SIEM and Microsoft 365 Defender, offering exceptional value for organizations already invested in Microsoft technologies. With inclusion in Microsoft 365 E5 licenses, it represents one of the most accessible enterprise threat intelligence platforms.
