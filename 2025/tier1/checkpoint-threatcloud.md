# Check Point ThreatCloud

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.
**Headquarters:** Tel Aviv, Israel / San Carlos, California, USA
**Founded:** 1993 (ThreatCloud established 2008)
**Website:** https://www.checkpoint.com/threatcloud-central/

Check Point ThreatCloud represents one of the world's largest collaborative cybersecurity intelligence networks, powered by hundreds of millions of Check Point security sensors deployed across network, cloud, mobile, and IoT environments globally. Processing over 3 billion artifacts and analyzing 250,000+ malware types daily, ThreatCloud delivers real-time threat intelligence using advanced AI and big data analytics to provide automated threat prevention across Check Point's comprehensive Infinity architecture. With roots dating back to 2008 as one of the first cloud-based collaborative threat intelligence systems, ThreatCloud pioneered the concept of community-powered security intelligence where global sensor data creates a self-reinforcing protection ecosystem. Unlike standalone CTI platforms, ThreatCloud intelligence is automatically distributed and enforced across Check Point's entire security portfolio—from Quantum security gateways and CloudGuard cloud security to Harmony endpoint, email, and mobile protection—providing zero-touch threat prevention at massive scale. The platform's ThreatCloud AI engine employs machine learning for predictive threat analysis, zero-day protection through behavior-based detection, and advanced threat extraction and emulation capabilities.
