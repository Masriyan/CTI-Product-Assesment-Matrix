**Headquarters:** Reston, Virginia, USA (Google: Mountain View, CA)
**Founded:** 2004 (Acquired by Google 2022)
**Website:** https://www.mandiant.com/

Mandiant Threat Intelligence, now part of Google Cloud, is one of the industry's most respected threat intelligence services. Born from years of frontline incident response experience, Mandiant provides intelligence derived from real-world breach investigations and nation-state threat research. With expertise forged through responding to over 1,000 breaches annually, Mandiant's intelligence is grounded in actual adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed during active incidents. The 2022 acquisition by Google combined Mandiant's elite threat intelligence with Google's massive scale, cloud infrastructure, and AI/ML capabilities.
