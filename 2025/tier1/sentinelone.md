# SentinelOne Singularity Threat Intelligence

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** SentinelOne, Inc.
**Headquarters:** Mountain View, California, USA
**Founded:** 2013
**Website:** https://www.sentinelone.com/

SentinelOne Singularity represents a new generation of AI-powered cybersecurity platforms that seamlessly integrates threat intelligence with autonomous endpoint detection and response (EDR), extended detection and response (XDR), and cloud workload protection. Unlike traditional signature-based approaches, SentinelOne leverages behavioral AI, machine learning models, and patented Storyline technology to provide real-time threat intelligence automatically applied across endpoint, cloud, identity, and IoT attack surfaces. Founded in 2013 and publicly traded since 2021 (NYSE: S), SentinelOne has rapidly emerged as a leading next-generation endpoint security platform with threat intelligence derived from millions of protected endpoints globally. The acquisition of Attivo Networks in 2021 enhanced SentinelOne's intelligence capabilities with identity threat detection and deception technology (ThreatMatrix), while WatchTower provides managed threat hunting as a service with expert analyst intelligence. The Singularity Data Lake aggregates telemetry across the entire security estate, enabling Purple AI—SentinelOne's generative AI security analyst—to provide natural language threat intelligence queries and automated investigation. Unlike product-embedded intelligence from traditional vendors, SentinelOne positions threat intelligence as core to its autonomous prevention, detection, and response platform, with emphasis on speed, automation, and zero-trust security for modern cloud and hybrid environments.
