# Kaspersky Threat Intelligence

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Kaspersky Lab (AO Kaspersky Lab)
**Headquarters:** Moscow, Russia / Registered in UK
**Founded:** 1997
**Website:** https://www.kaspersky.com/ | https://ti.kaspersky.com/

Kaspersky Threat Intelligence services represent some of the world's most technically sophisticated threat research capabilities, powered by the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) with telemetry from 400+ million users globally and the elite Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT)—widely considered one of the industry's premier APT research organizations. With over 25 years of deep malware analysis, reverse engineering, and threat actor tracking experience, Kaspersky delivers world-class intelligence on advanced persistent threats, nation-state operations, cybercrime ecosystems, and targeted attacks. The GReAT team has uncovered some of the most significant cyber espionage campaigns including Stuxnet analysis, Equation Group, Carbanak, and dozens of other sophisticated threat actors. Kaspersky's intelligence portfolio spans multiple specialized domains: financial threat intelligence (Kaspersky Fraud Prevention), industrial cybersecurity (Kaspersky ICS CERT), dark web monitoring, YARA rule development, and comprehensive IOC feeds. However, geopolitical factors have significantly impacted Kaspersky's market position—the US government banned Kaspersky products from federal agencies in 2017, followed by broader restrictions in 2024, and similar actions in UK, Lithuania, and other countries citing national security concerns. Despite these challenges, Kaspersky remains highly regarded in EMEA, APAC, LATAM, and among organizations specifically facing sophisticated nation-state threats or requiring deep technical APT intelligence.
