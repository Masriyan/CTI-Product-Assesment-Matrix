# Hudson Rock Cavalier

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Hudson Rock Cybercrime Intelligence Ltd.
**Headquarters:** Tel Aviv, Israel
**Founded:** 2019
**Website:** https://www.hudsonrock.com/

Hudson Rock carved out a unique niche in the threat intelligence market by specializing exclusively in information-stealing malware (infostealers)—recognizing that while the cybersecurity industry focused on preventing malware infections, a massive underground ecosystem had emerged where cybercriminals monetize data exfiltrated by commodity infostealers like Raccoon, RedLine, Vidar, and dozens of other malware families. These infostealers silently harvest credentials, browser cookies, cryptocurrency wallets, and saved passwords from infected computers, uploading the data to criminal-controlled servers where it's packaged into "logs" and sold on underground marketplaces for as little as a few dollars per infected machine. Hudson Rock's founders recognized the strategic value of these infostealer logs for both attackers and defenders: attackers purchase logs to identify high-value targets (corporate credentials, VPN access, admin accounts) for follow-on attacks, while defenders can use the same intelligence to proactively detect compromised accounts before they're exploited. The Cavalier platform ingests millions of infostealer logs from underground sources, extracting credentials, session cookies, and sensitive data, then organizing this intelligence by domain, email, and organization—enabling security teams to search for their corporate assets and receive immediate alerts when employee credentials or session tokens appear in new malware dumps.
