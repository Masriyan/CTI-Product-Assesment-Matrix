# Constella Intelligence

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Constella Intelligence Inc. (formerly ID Agent/4iQ)
**Headquarters:** Woburn, Massachusetts, USA
**Founded:** 2012 (as 4iQ)
**Website:** https://constellaintelligence.com/

Constella Intelligence emerged from pioneering research in identity breach intelligence, recognizing that the greatest threat to modern organizations isn't sophisticated zero-day exploits but rather the massive ecosystem of compromised credentials circulating across data breach databases, dark web marketplaces, and infostealer malware logs. The company's founders built one of the world's largest repositories of exposed credentials and personally identifiable information (PII) by systematically collecting and indexing data from thousands of breaches, underground forums, paste sites, and malware command-and-control servers—creating the Identity Breach Intelligence™ database containing billions of exposed identities. Constella's platform enables organizations to monitor this massive breach ecosystem for exposure of employee credentials, executive PII, customer accounts, and corporate data—providing immediate alerts when credentials appear in new breaches or underground marketplaces before attackers can weaponize them for account takeover, business email compromise, or network intrusion. The platform's strength lies in its comprehensive historical and real-time breach coverage combined with specialized focus areas: executive and VIP protection monitoring high-value individuals for doxing and targeting; customer credential protection enabling consumer-facing organizations to detect compromised user accounts; and MSP/MSSP programs providing managed service providers with white-label BrandProtection offerings for small business clients.
