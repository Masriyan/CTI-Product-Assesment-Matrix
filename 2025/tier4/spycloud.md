# SpyCloud Account Takeover Prevention

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** SpyCloud Inc.
**Headquarters:** Austin, Texas, USA
**Founded:** 2016
**Website:** https://spycloud.com/

SpyCloud established itself as the leader in account takeover (ATO) prevention by building the cybersecurity industry's largest repository of malware-exfiltrated credentials and session data—recognizing that traditional breach notification services provided limited value because they lacked the most dangerous source of compromised credentials: data stolen directly from endpoints by information-stealing malware. While organizations focused on detecting network breaches and monitoring dark web marketplaces, cybercriminals increasingly relied on commodity infostealers (Raccoon, RedLine, Vidar, AZORult, and dozens of others) to harvest credentials, cookies, and authentication tokens directly from infected computers—bypassing multi-factor authentication through session hijacking and enabling seamless account takeover without triggering login alerts. SpyCloud's intelligence team developed proprietary methods to recover data from infostealer malware command-and-control servers, criminal marketplaces, and underground distribution channels—ingesting billions of credentials along with the associated metadata (plaintext passwords, session cookies, browser fingerprints, device information) that enables high-fidelity identity intelligence. The platform's differentiator is automated remediation: rather than simply alerting security teams about compromised credentials, SpyCloud integrates directly with identity providers (Okta, Azure AD, Ping Identity) and authentication systems to automatically trigger password resets, invalidate compromised sessions, and block high-risk authentication attempts—preventing account takeover attacks before they succeed.
