# BitSight Security Ratings

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** BitSight Technologies Inc.
**Headquarters:** Boston, Massachusetts, USA
**Founded:** 2011
**Website:** https://www.bitsight.com/

BitSight pioneered the cybersecurity ratings industry by applying financial credit rating concepts to cybersecurity—creating an objective, quantifiable method to assess and compare organizational security posture without requiring internal access, agent deployment, or security questionnaires. The company recognized that traditional security assessments relied on self-reported data from vendors (questionnaires, attestations, certifications) that provided static snapshots of security controls but failed to measure actual security performance or detect deteriorating security posture in real-time. BitSight's platform continuously monitors the external security footprint of organizations worldwide, analyzing billions of security observations—botnet traffic, leaked credentials, patching cadence, encryption practices, DNS health, application security, endpoint security—to generate objective security ratings on an A-F scale. The ratings enable multiple critical use cases: third-party risk management programs use BitSight to assess vendor security without questionnaire overhead; cyber insurance underwriters leverage ratings for policy pricing and renewal decisions; boards and executives track organizational security performance against industry peers; M&A teams conduct cybersecurity due diligence on acquisition targets. BitSight's market leadership stems from widespread industry adoption: thousands of organizations rely on BitSight ratings for vendor risk decisions, making a strong BitSight rating increasingly important for business relationships, particularly in regulated industries like financial services and healthcare.
