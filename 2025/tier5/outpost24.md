# Outpost24 Cyber Threat Intelligence (formerly Blueliv)

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Outpost24 Group AB (acquired Blueliv 2019)
**Headquarters:** Karlstad, Sweden
**Founded:** 2001 (Outpost24) / 2013 (Blueliv)
**Website:** https://outpost24.com/

Outpost24 expanded its vulnerability management and penetration testing portfolio in 2019 by acquiring Blueliv, a Spanish cybersecurity company specializing in external threat intelligence and targeted attack prediction. The acquisition enabled Outpost24 to offer an integrated security platform combining internal vulnerability assessment (traditional Outpost24 strengths) with external threat intelligence (Blueliv capabilities)—creating a complete view of organizational risk by correlating exploitable vulnerabilities with active threat actor targeting. Blueliv built its reputation on targeted attack intelligence: monitoring underground forums, dark web marketplaces, and adversary communications to detect early-stage attack planning—identifying when organizations appeared in threat actor reconnaissance, when vulnerabilities in their specific technology stack were discussed as targets, when credentials leaked that could enable initial access, or when cybercriminal groups actively planned campaigns against particular industry sectors. The integrated Outpost24 CTI platform enhances vulnerability management by prioritizing patching based on active exploitation intelligence and threat actor targeting—helping organizations focus limited resources on vulnerabilities actually being weaponized against their environment rather than generic CVSS scores.
