# Prevalent Third-Party Risk Management

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Prevalent Inc.
**Headquarters:** Warren, New Jersey, USA
**Founded:** 2010
**Website:** https://www.prevalent.net/

Prevalent emerged as organizations struggled with the overwhelming complexity of third-party risk management: manually distributing security questionnaires to hundreds of vendors, chasing incomplete responses, lacking continuous visibility into vendor security posture changes, and failing to identify which vendor relationships posed the greatest risk. The company recognized that traditional TPRM relied on point-in-time assessments through security questionnaires—static documents that quickly became outdated, consumed enormous analyst time to review, created vendor fatigue from repetitive questions, and failed to detect security deterioration between annual assessments. Prevalent's platform transforms third-party risk management by combining three complementary approaches: automated security questionnaires leveraging pre-built templates and question libraries to streamline vendor assessments; continuous external monitoring using threat intelligence and attack surface scanning to track vendor security posture without requiring vendor participation; and risk scoring that prioritizes vendors based on data criticality, business impact, and security posture—enabling risk-based resource allocation. The platform's comprehensive TPRM capabilities extend to fourth-party risk (monitoring the vendors of your vendors), compliance mapping to regulatory frameworks (DORA, NYDFS, FFIEC), and vendor collaboration portals for remediation tracking—making it particularly strong in heavily-regulated industries like financial services and healthcare.
