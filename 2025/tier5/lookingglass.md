# LookingGlass Cyber Solutions

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** LookingGlass Cyber Solutions Inc.
**Headquarters:** Reston, Virginia, USA
**Founded:** 2009
**Website:** https://lookingglasscyber.com/

LookingGlass Cyber Solutions emerged from the defense and intelligence community with deep expertise in geopolitical cyber threat analysis, nation-state threat tracking, and critical infrastructure protection—bringing intelligence tradecraft developed for government agencies to commercial cybersecurity. The company recognized that traditional threat intelligence focused heavily on commodity threats (malware, phishing, credential theft) while leaving organizations exposed to sophisticated threats requiring different analytical approaches: nation-state espionage campaigns targeting intellectual property, geopolitically-motivated attacks against critical infrastructure, advanced persistent threats (APTs) conducting long-term reconnaissance, and state-sponsored influence operations. LookingGlass's scoutTHREAT platform combines external attack surface monitoring with strategic threat intelligence—tracking threat actor groups by geopolitical motivation and capabilities, analyzing malware campaigns for attribution and intent, monitoring critical infrastructure vulnerabilities exploited by nation-state actors, and providing geopolitical risk assessments that contextualize cyber threats within broader international relations. The platform's strength in government, defense contractors, and critical infrastructure sectors stems from its intelligence-centric approach: rather than simply cataloging threats, LookingGlass provides strategic context about adversary capabilities, intentions, and targeting patterns essential for organizations facing sophisticated threat actors.
