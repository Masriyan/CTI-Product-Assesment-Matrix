# SecurityScorecard

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** SecurityScorecard Inc.
**Headquarters:** New York, New York, USA
**Founded:** 2013
**Website:** https://securityscorecard.com/

SecurityScorecard entered the cybersecurity ratings market shortly after BitSight, challenging the industry pioneer by offering more accessible pricing for mid-market organizations and emphasizing comprehensive risk factor coverage. The company recognized that while security ratings addressed critical third-party risk management needs, existing solutions remained out of reach for many mid-sized organizations due to high costs and complexity. SecurityScorecard's platform evaluates organizational security across ten discrete risk factors—network security, DNS health, patching cadence, endpoint security, IP reputation, application security, cubit score, hacker chatter, information leak, and social engineering—providing granular visibility into specific security domains rather than a single composite score. The platform's Atlas threat intelligence integration adds external threat context to security ratings, monitoring for organization-specific threats, data leaks, and cybercrime discussions that could impact security posture. SecurityScorecard's competitive advantage in the mid-market stems from flexible pricing, user-friendly vendor collaboration features (enabling vendors to view and improve their own ratings), and automated vendor questionnaire workflows that complement continuous monitoring with targeted assessments.
