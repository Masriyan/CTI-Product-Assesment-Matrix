# Rapid7 Threat Command (formerly IntSights)

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Rapid7 Inc. (acquired IntSights 2021)
**Headquarters:** Boston, Massachusetts, USA
**Founded:** 2015 (IntSights)
**Website:** https://www.rapid7.com/products/threat-command/

Rapid7 acquired IntSights in 2021 to expand its vulnerability management and incident detection portfolio with external threat intelligence capabilities—creating an integrated platform where organizations can correlate external threats (dark web targeting, credential exposure, phishing campaigns) with internal vulnerability data (InsightVM) and security events (InsightIDR). IntSights built its reputation on providing targeted attack early warnings by monitoring underground forums, dark web marketplaces, and adversary communications for organization-specific threats—detecting when companies were discussed as potential targets, when credentials appeared in breach databases, when phishing infrastructure was established using lookalike domains, or when threat actors researched executives for social engineering attacks. The Threat Command platform's integration with Rapid7's broader security operations ecosystem enables unified workflows: external threat intelligence triggers vulnerability prioritization in InsightVM, credential exposures initiate automated incident response in InsightIDR, and phishing campaigns activate takedown procedures—creating a feedback loop between external threat monitoring and internal security operations. The platform's value proposition is strongest for existing Rapid7 customers who can leverage bundled pricing and native integrations across the Insight platform.
