# Shodan Enterprise

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Shodan (Achilleus, Inc.)
**Headquarters:** Austin, Texas, USA
**Founded:** 2009
**Website:** https://www.shodan.io/

Shodan revolutionized cybersecurity reconnaissance by creating the world's first search engine specifically designed to index internet-connected devices rather than web content—transforming security research, attack surface management, and vulnerability assessment. While Google indexes websites, Shodan continuously scans the entire IPv4 address space (and growing IPv6 coverage) to catalog every publicly accessible service: web servers, databases, industrial control systems, IoT devices, security cameras, SCADA systems, building automation, medical devices, and network infrastructure. The platform's value proposition is radical transparency: Shodan reveals what adversaries can already see—every misconfigured database exposed to the internet, every industrial control system accessible without authentication, every vulnerable IoT device broadcasting its presence, every forgotten development server still running in production. For security teams, Shodan Enterprise provides continuous monitoring to detect new exposures as they appear, alerting when critical systems become internet-accessible, tracking changes to external attack surface, and enabling proactive remediation before attackers discover vulnerabilities. The platform's database of historical scans enables trend analysis and attribution—identifying when exposures first appeared, tracking infrastructure changes over time, and correlating device characteristics for threat hunting.
