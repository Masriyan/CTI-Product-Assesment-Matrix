# PolySwarm

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** PolySwarm Inc.
**Headquarters:** San Diego, California, USA
**Founded:** 2017
**Website:** https://polyswarm.io/

PolySwarm disrupted the malware detection industry by creating a decentralized threat intelligence marketplace where multiple antivirus engines, security vendors, and independent researchers compete to analyze files and URLs—solving the fundamental limitation that single-engine or even traditional multi-scanner solutions provide incomplete threat coverage. Traditional antivirus relies on a single vendor's detection capabilities, while even multi-engine aggregators like VirusTotal combine engines that may use shared detection logic. PolySwarm's marketplace model incentivizes diverse detection approaches through blockchain-based rewards: security "engines" (vendors and researchers) stake cryptocurrency tokens on their detection verdicts, earning rewards for accurate threat identification and losing stakes for false positives—creating economic incentives for innovation, accuracy, and rapid detection of emerging threats. The platform aggregates 100+ diverse detection engines including commercial antivirus, specialized malware sandboxes, machine learning classifiers, and custom threat detection algorithms—providing comprehensive threat coverage that often identifies threats missed by traditional solutions. PolySwarm's competitive advantage extends beyond detection breadth to detection speed: the marketplace's competitive dynamics drive rapid analysis of new samples, often delivering verdicts faster than traditional vendor update cycles.
