# Censys Attack Surface Management

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Censys Inc.
**Headquarters:** Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA
**Founded:** 2017 (spinoff from University of Michigan research)
**Website:** https://censys.io/

Censys emerged from groundbreaking academic research at the University of Michigan that pioneered large-scale internet scanning and certificate transparency analysis—bringing academic rigor and scientific methodology to commercial attack surface management. While Shodan focused on device discovery, Censys emphasized comprehensive internet mapping with particular strength in SSL/TLS certificate intelligence, cloud asset discovery, and organizational asset attribution. The platform's research foundation enabled innovative capabilities: correlating certificate metadata to identify shadow IT and forgotten assets, tracking certificate reissuance patterns to detect phishing infrastructure, discovering cloud resources across AWS/Azure/GCP through DNS and certificate analysis, and providing historical context for infrastructure changes. Censys Attack Surface Management automatically discovers an organization's complete external-facing attack surface—domains, subdomains, IP addresses, cloud resources, certificates—then continuously monitors for changes, misconfigurations, and security exposures. The platform's academic credibility, combined with weekly scanning updates and comprehensive certificate intelligence, makes it particularly valuable for organizations with complex cloud environments, distributed infrastructure, and regulatory compliance requirements demanding complete asset visibility.
