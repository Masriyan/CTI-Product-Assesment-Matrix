# Team Cymru

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Team Cymru, Inc.
**Headquarters:** Lake Mary, Florida, USA
**Founded:** 1998
**Website:** https://www.team-cymru.com/

Team Cymru pioneered internet-scale threat intelligence by recognizing that network flow data—NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow records from ISPs and enterprises—provides unparalleled visibility into global internet traffic patterns, botnet command-and-control infrastructure, DDoS attack campaigns, and malware distribution networks. For over two decades, Team Cymru has operated as a trusted neutral party in the internet security community, providing both free community services (bogon lists, malware hash registry, IP/ASN reputation) and commercial threat intelligence products built on massive network flow data collection. The company's Pure Signal™ platform aggregates network flow telemetry from ISPs, cloud providers, and enterprises worldwide—analyzing billions of daily connections to identify malicious infrastructure, track botnet activity, detect DDoS attacks, and profile threat actor networks. Team Cymru's intelligence operates at internet infrastructure scale rather than endpoint or perimeter focus—tracking threats across autonomous systems (ASNs), identifying compromised networks, monitoring bulletproof hosting providers, and detecting network-level attack patterns invisible to traditional security tools. The company's reputation stems from long-standing relationships with law enforcement, CERTs, and ISPs—providing authoritative intelligence for takedown operations, criminal investigations, and internet abuse mitigation.
