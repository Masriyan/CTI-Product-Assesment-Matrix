# Dataminr

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Dataminr Inc.
**Headquarters:** New York, New York, USA
**Founded:** 2009
**Website:** https://www.dataminr.com/

Dataminr pioneered real-time event detection by applying artificial intelligence to analyze the global firehose of social media, news, and public data—delivering alerts about breaking events, cyber incidents, and security threats minutes to hours before traditional news media or security vendors. While conventional threat intelligence relies on retrospective analysis of past attacks, Dataminr provides prospective intelligence by detecting events as they unfold: data breaches announced on social media before official disclosure, physical security incidents affecting corporate facilities, geopolitical events impacting business operations, and cyber attacks discussed in underground forums. The platform's AI processes millions of social media posts, news articles, blog entries, and public datasets every minute—identifying statistically significant patterns that indicate emerging events and filtering out noise to surface high-confidence alerts. For security operations, Dataminr's value extends beyond traditional cybersecurity to comprehensive risk intelligence: detecting when corporate data appears in public leaks, monitoring for executive threats and doxing, tracking hacktivist targeting campaigns, identifying supply chain disruptions, and providing early warning of crises requiring security response. This real-time OSINT capability complements traditional CTI platforms by providing context unavailable from technical indicators alone.
