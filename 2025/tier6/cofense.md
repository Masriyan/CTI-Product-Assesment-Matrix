# Cofense Intelligence

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Cofense Inc. (formerly PhishMe)
**Headquarters:** Leesburg, Virginia, USA
**Founded:** 2008
**Website:** https://cofense.com/

Cofense pioneered crowdsourced phishing intelligence by recognizing that employees receiving phishing emails possess invaluable threat intelligence if empowered to report suspicious messages—transforming end users from security's weakest link into an active threat detection network. While traditional email security relies on automated detection that struggles with sophisticated social engineering, Cofense's approach leverages millions of trained employees across customer organizations who report suspicious emails through Cofense's Phishing Defense Center—creating a global sensor network that detects phishing campaigns in their earliest stages, often before automated systems recognize the threat. The Cofense Intelligence platform aggregates and analyzes this crowdsourced reporting combined with automated malware analysis to provide real-time intelligence on active phishing campaigns, malicious infrastructure, business email compromise (BEC) attempts, and credential harvesting operations. This intelligence enables organizations to proactively block phishing infrastructure, update email gateway rules, and alert users about active campaigns targeting their industry—often within hours of campaign launch rather than waiting for vendor signature updates.
