# Nisos

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Nisos Inc.
**Headquarters:** Alexandria, Virginia, USA
**Founded:** 2017
**Website:** https://nisos.com/

Nisos differentiated itself in the threat intelligence market by combining investigative tradecraft from law enforcement and intelligence agencies with technology platforms—providing managed intelligence services rather than pure self-service software. The company recognized that many high-stakes threat investigations require specialized expertise beyond automated collection: cryptocurrency theft recovery requires blockchain forensics specialists, executive targeting investigations need social engineering and HUMINT expertise, fraud investigations demand financial crime analysis, and complex attribution requires deep adversary research. Nisos' managed intelligence model delivers expert-driven investigations alongside its Navigator technology platform—enabling organizations to outsource complex intelligence requirements to analysts with law enforcement, intelligence community, and investigative backgrounds. The company's competitive advantage lies in specialized investigative capabilities: cryptocurrency tracking and recovery for theft and ransom investigations, deep/dark web investigations requiring covert access to restricted forums, fraud and financial crime intelligence for banking and fintech, and custom intelligence projects for unique organizational threats. This boutique approach serves organizations facing sophisticated threats requiring investigative depth rather than automated monitoring breadth.
