# Proofpoint Emerging Threats Intelligence

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Proofpoint, Inc.
**Headquarters:** Sunnyvale, California, USA
**Founded:** 2002
**Website:** https://www.proofpoint.com/

Proofpoint Emerging Threats (ET) Intelligence represents one of the longest-running and most widely deployed network threat intelligence services, originating from the community-driven Emerging Threats project that pioneered open-source IDS/IPS rulesets before Proofpoint acquisition. ET Intelligence provides network security teams with continuously updated detection rules for Suricata and Snort intrusion detection systems, IP/domain reputation feeds, and threat intelligence focused on network-level attacks—enabling organizations to detect malware command-and-control traffic, exploit attempts, botnet activity, and malicious network behavior. The platform's strength lies in rapid rule development: security researchers analyze emerging threats and publish detection signatures within hours, enabling organizations to deploy defenses against new attack techniques before widespread exploitation. ET Open provides free community rulesets updated daily, while ET Pro offers commercial subscribers additional high-fidelity rules, reputation data, and threat intelligence feeds. Post-Proofpoint acquisition, ET Intelligence integrates with Proofpoint's email and cloud security portfolio—enabling correlation between email-borne threats and subsequent network activity for comprehensive attack chain visibility.
