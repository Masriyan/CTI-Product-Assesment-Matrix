# GreyNoise

## Overview
GreyNoise is a cybersecurity intelligence platform that identifies and characterizes internet background noise—mass internet scanning, botnets, and opportunistic exploitation—helping security teams distinguish between targeted attacks and mass scanning activity. By filtering out noise, GreyNoise enables organizations to focus on real threats and reduce alert fatigue.

## Key Features
- Internet background noise intelligence
- Mass scanning activity identification
- Benign vs. malicious scanner classification
- IP reputation with intent classification
- RIOT (Rule It Out) dataset for known good IPs
- Visualization of internet scanning activity
- API for automated noise filtering
- Integration with SIEM and security tools
- Global sensor network
- Community and enterprise datasets

## Pros
- Unique focus on internet background noise filtering
- Excellent for reducing false positives and alert fatigue
- Free community edition available
- Good classification of scanner intent (benign vs. malicious)
- RIOT dataset helps rule out known-good traffic
- User-friendly web interface and visualizations
- Strong API for integration
- Fast response to emerging scanning campaigns
- Cost-effective solution
- Active community and support

## Cons
- Specialized focus on noise filtering vs. comprehensive CTI
- Limited strategic threat intelligence
- Best suited for noise reduction use case
- Not a full threat intelligence platform
- Limited threat actor attribution
- Integration primarily through API
- Query limits on free tier
- Less valuable for organizations not facing mass scanning
