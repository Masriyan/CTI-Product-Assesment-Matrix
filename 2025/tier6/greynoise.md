# GreyNoise Intelligence

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** GreyNoise Intelligence Inc.
**Headquarters:** Washington, D.C., USA
**Founded:** 2017
**Website:** https://www.greynoise.io/

GreyNoise solved a critical problem that plagued security operations centers worldwide: alert fatigue from mass internet scanning activity that triggers detection systems but represents zero targeted threat. While security teams investigated thousands of alerts daily, the vast majority originated from benign security scanners, search engine crawlers, academic research projects, and opportunistic botnets blindly scanning the internet—consuming analyst time without providing actionable intelligence about targeted attacks. GreyNoise deployed a global network of sensors to observe internet background noise, cataloging every IP address conducting mass scanning activity and classifying scanner intent: benign (security researchers, search engines), malicious (botnets, exploit scanners), or unknown. The platform's RIOT (Rule It Out) dataset specifically identifies known-good infrastructure—CDNs, DNS resolvers, update servers, security vendors—enabling immediate dismissal of benign traffic. For SOC analysts, GreyNoise integration transforms alert triage: before investigating an IP address, query GreyNoise to determine if it's mass scanning (ignore) or targeted reconnaissance (investigate)—reducing false positives by 60-80% and enabling analysts to focus on real threats.
