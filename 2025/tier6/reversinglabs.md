# ReversingLabs TitaniumCloud

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** ReversingLabs
**Headquarters:** Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA
**Founded:** 2009
**Website:** https://www.reversinglabs.com/

ReversingLabs revolutionized malware analysis by pioneering automated static analysis at scale—enabling organizations to analyze billions of files without the time and resource constraints of traditional dynamic sandboxing. While sandbox solutions execute malware in isolated environments to observe behavior (requiring minutes per sample), ReversingLabs' static analysis technology decomposes files into components, extracts code characteristics, and classifies threats in milliseconds—making it practical to analyze every file entering an organization rather than sampling suspicious files. The company's TitaniumCloud platform maintains one of the world's largest file reputation databases, cataloging over 10 billion analyzed files with detailed threat classifications, malware family attribution, and behavioral characteristics. ReversingLabs' competitive advantage extends beyond speed to accuracy: static analysis detects evasive malware designed to evade sandbox analysis, identifies trojanized legitimate software, and discovers supply chain compromises embedded in software packages. The Spectra Assure platform applies this technology to software supply chain security—analyzing software releases, container images, and firmware to detect malicious code, vulnerable components, and integrity violations before deployment.
