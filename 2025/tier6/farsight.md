# Farsight Security DNSDB

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Farsight Security, Inc.
**Headquarters:** San Mateo, California, USA
**Founded:** 2013
**Website:** https://www.farsightsecurity.com/

Farsight Security built the world's largest and most comprehensive passive DNS (pDNS) database by recognizing that DNS resolution data provides critical forensic evidence for investigating cyber threats, tracking adversary infrastructure, and understanding attack campaigns. While traditional DNS simply resolves domain names to IP addresses in real-time, passive DNS collects and preserves historical resolution data—creating a searchable archive of how domains and IPs have been interconnected over time. Farsight's DNSDB platform ingests DNS traffic from authoritative name servers, recursive resolvers, and sensor networks worldwide—cataloging billions of daily DNS observations to create the definitive historical record of internet domain-to-IP relationships. This intelligence enables investigators to pivot from a single malicious domain discovered today to uncover an entire threat actor infrastructure ecosystem built over months or years: identifying previously unknown malicious domains through shared IP relationships, discovering command-and-control servers by tracking DGA patterns, attributing threats through persistent infrastructure reuse, and detecting phishing campaigns through typosquatting domain clusters. DNSDB's newly observed domains (NOD) detection provides early warning when threat actors register new infrastructure—alerting within hours of domain activation rather than waiting for malicious activity to trigger traditional detection systems.
