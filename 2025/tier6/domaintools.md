# DomainTools

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** DomainTools LLC
**Headquarters:** Seattle, Washington, USA
**Founded:** 2002
**Website:** https://www.domaintools.com/

DomainTools pioneered domain and DNS intelligence by recognizing that internet infrastructure—domain registrations, DNS configurations, WHOIS records, SSL certificates—provides critical forensic evidence for investigating cyber threats, tracking adversary infrastructure, and protecting brands from abuse. For over two decades, DomainTools has operated the internet's most comprehensive WHOIS database, collecting and preserving historical registration data that enables investigators to connect disparate threats through shared infrastructure patterns: threat actors reusing email addresses across multiple malicious domains, cybercriminal operations registering typosquatting domains in bulk, phishing campaigns utilizing similar SSL certificate characteristics, and malware infrastructure exhibiting consistent DNS patterns. The platform's Iris Investigate interface transforms raw infrastructure data into investigative intelligence through powerful pivoting capabilities—starting from a single malicious domain to discover entire adversary infrastructure ecosystems. DomainTools' passive DNS database records historical DNS resolution data, enabling analysts to track how infrastructure evolves over time, identify when domains transition from legitimate to malicious use, and attribute threats through persistent infrastructure relationships that survive domain takedowns and hosting changes.
