# Analyst1

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Analyst1, Inc.
**Headquarters:** Reston, Virginia, USA
**Founded:** 2014
**Website:** https://analyst1.com/

Analyst1 was founded on a simple but powerful premise: threat intelligence becomes valuable only when analysts can quickly connect disparate pieces of evidence to understand who is attacking, what they're after, and why they matter to your organization. The platform distinguishes itself through evidence-based threat actor profiling and adversary infrastructure tracking, enabling security teams to move beyond generic IOC feeds to understanding the context, capabilities, and intent behind cyber threats. Unlike aggregation-focused TIP vendors, Analyst1 emphasizes validated intelligence with clear evidence trails—every threat actor profile, infrastructure connection, and malware attribution is backed by observable evidence that analysts can review and validate. The platform's intelligence graph enables analysts to explore relationships between threat actors, campaigns, malware families, infrastructure, and attack patterns, transforming isolated indicators into coherent adversary narratives. Analyst1's research team continuously tracks 300+ threat actor groups across APT, cybercrime, and hacktivism categories, providing detailed profiles including motivations, capabilities, targeting patterns, and TTPs mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This adversary-centric approach resonates with threat hunters, incident responders, and intelligence analysts who need to answer: "Who attacked us, what else have they done, and what should we expect next?" The platform's competitive mid-market pricing and focus on analyst productivity have made it popular among organizations building or maturing their threat intelligence capabilities.
