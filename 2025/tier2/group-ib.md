# Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Group-IB (Group-Information Business)
**Headquarters:** Singapore (relocated from Russia in 2021)
**Founded:** 2003
**Website:** https://www.group-ib.com/

Group-IB represents a unique positioning in the global threat intelligence market: a company founded by Russian cybersecurity experts who built world-class APT investigation and attribution capabilities, now operating from Singapore with a truly global reach. Since its 2003 founding, Group-IB has evolved from a high-tech crime investigation consultancy into a comprehensive threat intelligence and incident response powerhouse with particular expertise in tracking sophisticated threat actors across APAC, EMEA, and CIS regions. The company's Threat Intelligence & Attribution (TI&A) platform combines technical threat intelligence with deep adversary attribution capabilities honed through years of collaboration with law enforcement agencies on high-profile cybercrime investigations. Unlike Western-centric intelligence platforms, Group-IB provides unparalleled visibility into Russian-speaking cybercrime ecosystems, Chinese APT operations, and APAC-originated threats—intelligence gaps that Western vendors struggle to fill. The platform integrates with Computer Emergency Response Team Group-IB (CERT-GIB), which provides 24/7 incident response, digital forensics, and proactive threat hunting services. Group-IB's intelligence is particularly valued for financial fraud prevention, tracking sophisticated banking trojans, ransomware operations, and APT campaigns targeting financial services, government, and critical infrastructure. The company's annual Hi-Tech Crime Trends reports are widely respected industry benchmarks. While the company's Russian origins and subsequent Singapore relocation create geopolitical considerations for some Western organizations, Group-IB has established a strong customer base in APAC, EMEA, and increasingly in Western markets seeking comprehensive global threat coverage.
