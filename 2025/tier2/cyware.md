# Cyware CTIX (Cyber Threat Intelligence eXchange)

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Cyware Labs, Inc.
**Headquarters:** New York, New York, USA
**Founded:** 2016
**Website:** https://cyware.com/

Cyware entered the cybersecurity market with a vision to solve the collaboration gap in threat intelligence and security operations—recognizing that isolated security teams and siloed intelligence create vulnerabilities that sophisticated adversaries exploit. The company's flagship Cyber Threat Intelligence eXchange (CTIX) platform emerged from this philosophy, positioning intelligence sharing and automation as the foundation for modern cyber defense. Unlike traditional threat intelligence platforms that emphasize aggregation and analysis within a single organization, CTIX is purpose-built for bidirectional intelligence sharing across teams, organizations, and communities—enabling ISACs, information sharing groups, MSSPs, and enterprises to create collaborative defense networks. The platform integrates seamlessly with Cyware's Fusion and Response (CFTR) SOAR platform, forming a comprehensive "Virtual Cyber Fusion Center" that combines threat intelligence, orchestration, and collaborative response capabilities. CTIX serves as both a standalone TIP for organizations seeking intelligence automation and enrichment, and as the intelligence backbone for the broader Cyware Cyber Fusion suite. The platform's strength lies in making threat intelligence operational and shareable—automatically ingesting intelligence from 100+ sources, enriching indicators with context, normalizing data formats, scoring threats by relevance, and enabling one-click sharing with trusted partners via STIX/TAXII, private communities, or custom channels. Cyware's competitive pricing and focus on mid-market accessibility have made it a popular choice for organizations seeking enterprise-grade threat intelligence capabilities without Tier 1 vendor pricing.
