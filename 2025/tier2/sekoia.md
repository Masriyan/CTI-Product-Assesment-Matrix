# SEKOIA.IO XDR & Threat Intelligence

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** SEKOIA.IO
**Headquarters:** Paris, France
**Founded:** 2016
**Website:** https://www.sekoia.io/

SEKOIA.IO emerged from the French cybersecurity landscape with an ambitious vision: unify extended detection and response (XDR) with threat intelligence in a single, cloud-native platform purpose-built for European regulatory requirements and threat landscapes. Unlike American XDR vendors that added threat intelligence as an afterthought, or pure-play TIP vendors attempting to bolt on detection capabilities, SEKOIA.IO architected both disciplines together from inception—creating a platform where threat intelligence automatically feeds detection rules, enriches alerts, and enables context-aware response actions. The company's Threat Intelligence Center (TIC) curates intelligence from 100+ sources while SEKOIA.IO's research team (based in France) produces original intelligence focused on European threat actors, French-language cybercrime, and threats targeting EU critical infrastructure. The platform's strong emphasis on GDPR compliance, NIS2 directive alignment, and European data residency makes it particularly attractive for EU organizations navigating complex regulatory requirements while seeking advanced security operations capabilities. SEKOIA.IO's XDR capabilities include log management, SIEM functionality, automated detection rules, playbook-driven response, and integrated threat hunting—all enhanced by contextual threat intelligence. This unified approach appeals to mid-market European organizations seeking to consolidate security operations tools while meeting strict data sovereignty and privacy requirements.
