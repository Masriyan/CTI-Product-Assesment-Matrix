# EclecticIQ Intelligence Center

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** EclecticIQ B.V.
**Headquarters:** Amsterdam, Netherlands
**Founded:** 2014
**Website:** https://www.eclecticiq.com/

EclecticIQ Intelligence Center represents a distinctly analyst-centric approach to threat intelligence platforms, built from the ground up to support professional intelligence analysts applying structured analytical techniques and intelligence cycle methodologies. Founded in 2014 by former government intelligence analysts in the Netherlands, EclecticIQ designed its platform around the principles taught in intelligence academies and practiced in government intelligence organizations—moving beyond simple indicator aggregation to support the full spectrum of intelligence production, from requirements planning to collection, processing, analysis, production, and dissemination. This intelligence-first philosophy differentiates EclecticIQ from commercial TIP vendors that evolved from security operations or vulnerability management backgrounds. The Intelligence Center platform enables analysts to build sophisticated threat intelligence products using structured analytical techniques (SATs) such as analysis of competing hypotheses, structured brainstorming, and link analysis—methodologies traditionally reserved for government intelligence but increasingly critical for enterprise security. EclecticIQ's graph-based analysis engine allows analysts to explore complex relationships between threat actors, campaigns, infrastructure, and targets, while the platform's fusion capabilities enable correlation of intelligence from multiple sources to produce higher-confidence assessments. The platform's native STIX 2.1 support (not retrofit) reflects its standards-first architecture, facilitating intelligence sharing with ISACs, CERTs, government partners, and commercial vendors. EclecticIQ has cultivated a strong presence in European markets, government/defense sectors, and organizations building mature threat intelligence programs with dedicated analyst teams.
