# SOCRadar Extended Threat Intelligence (XTI)

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** SOCRadar Inc.
**Headquarters:** Istanbul, Turkey / Delaware, USA
**Founded:** 2016
**Website:** https://socradar.io/

SOCRadar pioneered the concept of Extended Threat Intelligence (XTI)—expanding traditional threat intelligence beyond internal network telemetry to encompass the entire external threat landscape including attack surface monitoring, dark web intelligence, vulnerability tracking, and third-party risk assessment. Founded in Turkey with global operations, SOCRadar recognized that modern cyber threats originate from outside organizational perimeters: attackers scan external assets for vulnerabilities, purchase corporate credentials on dark web marketplaces, exploit unpatched systems discovered through attack surface reconnaissance, and compromise third-party vendors as entry points. The SOCRadar XTI platform automatically discovers and monitors an organization's external-facing attack surface—including domains, subdomains, IP addresses, cloud assets, SSL certificates, and exposed services—continuously scanning for misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and security exposures. The platform's Dark Web & Cyber Threat Intelligence module monitors 1,000+ underground sources for organization-specific threats: leaked credentials, corporate data for sale, ransomware targeting, and brand abuse. SOCRadar's competitive pricing, rapid deployment, and focus on actionable external intelligence have made it particularly popular among mid-market organizations and MSSPs seeking comprehensive external threat visibility without the complexity and cost of enterprise TIP platforms.
