# Flashpoint

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Flashpoint (Crypsis Group Company)
**Headquarters:** New York City, New York, USA
**Founded:** 2010
**Website:** https://flashpoint.io/

Flashpoint pioneered the Business Risk Intelligence (BRI) category by expanding threat intelligence beyond traditional cyber indicators to encompass brand protection, physical security, fraud detection, and geopolitical risk—all derived from deep monitoring of illicit online communities. Unlike cybercrime-only platforms, Flashpoint combines automated collection with human intelligence (HUMINT) to monitor deep and dark web forums, chat services, marketplaces, paste sites, and social media, providing holistic risk intelligence for enterprises facing diverse threats. The 2021 acquisition of VulnDB—the industry's most comprehensive commercial vulnerability intelligence database—significantly enhanced Flashpoint's technical capabilities, enabling vulnerability-centric threat intelligence and exploit tracking. The platform serves as a single source for cyber threats (malware, exploits, data breaches), fraud intelligence (financial crime, account takeovers), brand risks (counterfeit goods, executive threats), and geopolitical events affecting business operations. Flashpoint Copilot, an AI-powered natural language search interface, allows analysts to query the platform conversationally, dramatically improving intelligence discovery and analysis speed. With 10+ years of archived underground communications and strong HUMINT tradecraft, Flashpoint provides early warning of emerging threats, threat actor profiling, and contextual finished intelligence reports that enable proactive risk mitigation.
