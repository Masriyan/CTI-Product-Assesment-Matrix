# Silobreaker

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Silobreaker AB
**Headquarters:** Stockholm, Sweden / London, UK
**Founded:** 2009
**Website:** https://www.silobreaker.com/

Silobreaker pioneered the concept of aggregating and analyzing open-source intelligence (OSINT), news, dark web data, and commercial threat feeds in a single searchable platform—transforming disparate information streams into actionable intelligence through advanced search, visualization, and relationship mapping. Founded in Sweden in 2009, Silobreaker emerged from the academic research of its founders at Stockholm University, who developed sophisticated algorithms for extracting relationships and trends from massive volumes of unstructured text. Unlike traditional threat intelligence platforms that focus on technical indicators (IOCs), Silobreaker excels at strategic and operational intelligence—monitoring geopolitical events, tracking threat actor discussions across 100,000+ sources including news media, social media, dark web forums, government advisories, and commercial intelligence feeds. The platform's power lies in its ability to answer strategic questions: "What emerging threats are targeting my industry?", "How is the geopolitical situation affecting my risk posture?", "What are threat actors saying about vulnerabilities in my technology stack?" Silobreaker's relationship mapping visualizes connections between threat actors, malware families, vulnerabilities, geographies, and industries—enabling analysts to discover non-obvious patterns and emerging threats. This strategic intelligence focus appeals to threat intelligence analysts, risk managers, executive protection teams, and security leaders seeking situational awareness beyond tactical IOCs.
