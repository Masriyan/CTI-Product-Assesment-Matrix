# CYFIRMA DeCYFIR

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** CYFIRMA (CYber FIRst Mover Advantage)
**Headquarters:** Tokyo, Japan / Singapore
**Founded:** 2019
**Website:** https://www.cyfirma.com/

CYFIRMA entered the threat intelligence market with a bold proposition: shift security teams from reactive defense to predictive threat intelligence that anticipates attacks before they occur. The company's DeCYFIR platform (Detection, CYber FIRst Mover Advantage) combines external threat landscape management, attack surface discovery, and AI-powered predictive analytics to answer the critical question every CISO asks: "Who is targeting my organization, and what will they do next?" Unlike traditional threat intelligence platforms that aggregate indicators from past attacks, CYFIRMA emphasizes forward-looking intelligence—analyzing threat actor behavior, targeting patterns, and attack planning to provide early warning of imminent threats. Founded in 2019 by cybersecurity veterans with backgrounds in government intelligence and enterprise security, CYFIRMA has rapidly built a presence in APAC markets (particularly Japan, Singapore, India) while expanding into North America and EMEA. The platform's External Threat Landscape Management (ETLM) approach monitors the external attack surface, dark web chatter, threat actor communications, and vulnerability weaponization to create a predictive threat model specific to each customer. Industry-specific intelligence modules for healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, and critical infrastructure provide tailored threat intelligence addressing sector-specific attack patterns. CYFIRMA's strength lies in targeted threat intelligence—identifying which threat actors are researching your organization, what vulnerabilities they're discussing, and what attack vectors they're preparing—rather than flooding analysts with generic global threat feeds.
