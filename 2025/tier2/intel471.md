# Intel 471 TITAN

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Intel 471 Inc.
**Headquarters:** Amsterdam, Netherlands / Reston, Virginia, USA
**Founded:** 2014
**Website:** https://intel471.com/

Intel 471 represents the gold standard in cybercrime intelligence, founded by former national intelligence agency professionals who apply tradecraft methodologies to monitor, infiltrate, and report on the global criminal underground. Unlike broad-spectrum threat intelligence platforms, Intel 471 specializes exclusively in financially motivated cybercrime—tracking ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operations, initial access brokers (IABs), malware developers, stolen credential marketplaces, and the communications of prolific threat actors across deep web forums, private messaging channels, and underground marketplaces. The TITAN intelligence platform delivers what Intel 471 calls "adversary and malware intelligence"—deep human intelligence (HUMINT) combined with technical indicators that provide early warning of emerging threats, planned attacks, and evolving criminal tactics. Intel 471's analyst team maintains direct access to closed criminal forums and private communications, often detecting ransomware affiliate recruitment, zero-day exploit sales, and corporate network access listings weeks or months before attacks occur. This proactive intelligence enables financial institutions, enterprises, and incident response teams to preempt threats rather than react to them. The company's strength lies in intelligence quality over quantity—each report is vetted, contextualized, and delivered with adversary attribution and actionable recommendations.
