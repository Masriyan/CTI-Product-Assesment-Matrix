# ThreatConnect

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** ThreatConnect, Inc.
**Headquarters:** Arlington, Virginia, USA
**Founded:** 2011
**Website:** https://threatconnect.com/

ThreatConnect pioneered the concept of "intelligence-driven security operations" by building a comprehensive Threat Intelligence Platform that seamlessly combines threat intelligence management, orchestration, analytics, and automation into a unified solution. Founded in 2011 by former government intelligence analysts, ThreatConnect was purpose-built to address the operational challenge of transforming raw threat data into actionable security decisions at enterprise scale. The platform's differentiator is the Collective Analytics Layer (CAL™)—a collaborative threat intelligence ecosystem where community members share vetted intelligence, creating a force-multiplier effect that enhances individual organizational intelligence with collective community insights. Unlike pure aggregation platforms, ThreatConnect emphasizes intelligence operationalization through native playbook automation, Diamond Model and Kill Chain analytics, MITRE ATT&CK integration, and comprehensive case management for incident response. The platform serves as both a TIP (Threat Intelligence Platform) and lightweight SOAR, enabling organizations to ingest intelligence from 200+ sources, enrich it with internal context, analyze it using structured analytical frameworks, and automatically orchestrate response actions across security infrastructure. ThreatConnect's strong government and defense contractor heritage provides deep expertise in strategic intelligence workflows, adversary tracking, and intelligence sharing within trusted communities (ISACs, sector-specific groups).
