# KELA Cyber Intelligence Platform

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** KELA (Krime Exploiting Linear Analysis)
**Headquarters:** Tel Aviv, Israel
**Founded:** 2019
**Website:** https://ke-la.com/

KELA carved out a unique niche in the threat intelligence market by laser-focusing on financially motivated cybercrime—specifically ransomware operations, initial access brokers (IABs), and the underground economy that fuels modern cyber extortion. Founded in 2019 by cybercrime intelligence specialists, KELA's platform translates the chaotic, multilingual chatter of underground forums, Telegram channels, and dark web marketplaces into actionable early-warning intelligence for enterprises. Unlike broad-spectrum threat intelligence platforms, KELA specializes exclusively in monitoring threat actors who sell corporate network access, advertise ransomware affiliateprograms, trade stolen credentials, and auction compromised databases—the precursors to devastating ransomware attacks and data breaches. The platform automatically monitors 500+ underground communities, translating Russian, Chinese, Arabic, and other languages into English, and uses AI to identify when your organization, employees, or assets are mentioned, targeted, or offered for sale. KELA's intelligence has proven particularly valuable for preempting ransomware attacks by detecting when initial access to your network is being sold weeks or months before encryption occurs. The company's focus on actionable, organization-specific intelligence—not generic global threat feeds—resonates with CISOs seeking to answer: "Is my company being targeted right now?" This specificity, combined with competitive mid-market pricing, has made KELA popular among financial services, healthcare, and mid-market enterprises facing ransomware threats.
