# ThreatQuotient (ThreatQ)

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** ThreatQuotient, Inc.
**Headquarters:** Reston, Virginia, USA
**Founded:** 2013
**Website:** https://www.threatquotient.com/

ThreatQuotient's ThreatQ platform addresses the fundamental challenge facing security operations teams: prioritizing and acting on the most relevant threats amid overwhelming volumes of threat data. Founded in 2013 with a singular focus on reducing analyst workload through intelligent automation, ThreatQ distinguishes itself through its adaptive threat prioritization engine that continuously scores and re-scores threat intelligence based on organizational context, external feeds, and analyst feedback. Unlike platforms emphasizing aggregation alone, ThreatQ positions threat prioritization as its core differentiator, automatically surfacing the threats that matter most to each organization while suppressing noise and false positives. The platform's Adaptive Threat Library serves as the central nervous system for threat intelligence operations, ingesting data from hundreds of sources and applying sophisticated scoring algorithms that consider threat severity, confidence, asset criticality, industry relevance, and historical accuracy. ThreatQ Investigations provides structured case management for incident response, while ThreatQ TDR Orchestrator enables automated threat detection and response workflows. The platform's API-first architecture and flexible data model allow organizations to customize intelligence workflows to match their unique operational requirements, making it particularly appealing to enterprises with complex, multi-team security operations.
