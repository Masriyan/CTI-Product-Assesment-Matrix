# Resecurity Context

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Resecurity, Inc.
**Headquarters:** Los Angeles, California, USA
**Founded:** 2016
**Website:** https://www.resecurity.com/

Resecurity entered the cybersecurity intelligence market with a specialized focus on adversary-centric intelligence, dark web monitoring, and digital risk protection—addressing the growing threat of credential compromise, account takeover, and financial fraud. The company's Context™ platform combines underground intelligence collection with automated credential monitoring, brand protection, and executive threat detection to provide organizations with early warning of targeted attacks and data exposures. Resecurity's intelligence team maintains access to 500+ underground forums, marketplaces, Telegram channels, and paste sites where cybercriminals trade stolen credentials, sell network access, advertise fraud services, and leak corporate data. The platform's automated monitoring detects when employee credentials appear in stealer logs or data breaches, when corporate assets are mentioned in underground discussions, or when executives are targeted for social engineering attacks. Unlike pure-play threat intelligence platforms focused on technical indicators, Resecurity emphasizes actionable digital risk intelligence that enables immediate remediation—alerting security teams to compromised accounts before they're exploited, detecting brand abuse before customer harm, and identifying data leaks before competitive or regulatory exposure. The company's competitive mid-market pricing and rapid deployment have made it popular among financial services, e-commerce, and healthcare organizations facing credential-based attacks and account takeover fraud.
