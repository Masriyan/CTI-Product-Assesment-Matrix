# S2W QUAXAR (South Korea)

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** S2W Inc.
**Headquarters:** Seoul, South Korea
**Founded:** 2015
**Website:** https://www.s2w.inc/

S2W differentiated itself in the Asia-Pacific threat intelligence market by developing specialized expertise in North Korean threat actors—filling a critical intelligence gap for South Korean, Japanese, and global organizations facing persistent targeting by DPRK-affiliated groups including Lazarus, Kimsuky, and APT38. While global threat intelligence vendors provide broad coverage, S2W recognized that organizations in South Korea, Japan, and the broader APAC region required deep contextual intelligence on North Korean cyber operations: cryptocurrency theft campaigns conducted by DPRK to evade international sanctions, spear-phishing operations targeting defense contractors and government agencies, supply chain attacks on South Korean technology companies, and reconnaissance operations against financial institutions. The QUAXAR platform combines S2W's North Korean threat actor expertise with comprehensive APAC-focused intelligence: Korean and Chinese underground forum monitoring, regional malware analysis understanding language-specific social engineering, cryptocurrency fraud intelligence tracking Asia-Pacific crypto exchanges, and ransomware intelligence covering threats prevalent in the region. S2W's competitive advantage stems from Korean-language OSINT capabilities, direct experience responding to North Korean incidents, and regional threat landscape knowledge—enabling earlier detection of APAC-targeted campaigns and contextual intelligence unavailable from Western-centric platforms.
