# ThreatBook (微步在线) (China)

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** ThreatBook Technology Co., Ltd. (北京微步在线科技有限公司)
**Headquarters:** Beijing, China
**Founded:** 2015
**Website:** https://www.threatbook.cn/

ThreatBook (微步在线) emerged as one of China's leading threat intelligence companies by recognizing that Chinese enterprises and government agencies required specialized threat intelligence addressing the unique Chinese threat landscape: APT campaigns targeting Chinese organizations using Mandarin-language social engineering, malware variants circulating primarily in Chinese cyberspace, underground marketplace intelligence from Chinese criminal forums, and threat intelligence aligned with Chinese cybersecurity regulations and data sovereignty requirements. While global threat intelligence vendors provide broad international coverage, ThreatBook's X Community platform (X社区) combines deep Chinese threat landscape expertise with comprehensive threat intelligence capabilities: tracking Chinese-speaking threat actors and their tactics, monitoring Chinese underground forums and marketplaces inaccessible to Western researchers, analyzing malware samples prevalent in Chinese networks, and providing vulnerability intelligence aligned with China National Vulnerability Database (CNVD) and regulatory frameworks. The platform's competitive advantage stems from ThreatBook's position within the Chinese cybersecurity ecosystem—enabling access to Chinese-language threat intelligence sources, collaboration with Chinese security vendors and researchers, and early detection of threats targeting organizations operating in Greater China before they appear in international intelligence feeds. This regional specialization combined with cloud-native platform architecture positions ThreatBook as the premier threat intelligence provider for China-based security operations.
