# Gatewatcher CTI (France)

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Gatewatcher SAS
**Headquarters:** Issy-les-Moulineaux, France
**Founded:** 2015
**Website:** https://www.gatewatcher.com/

Gatewatcher emerged from France's growing cybersecurity sector to address European organizations' need for network detection and response (NDR) solutions that provide deep packet inspection capabilities while maintaining compliance with European data sovereignty and privacy regulations (GDPR, NIS2). The company recognized that while global NDR vendors offered powerful capabilities, many European organizations required data residency assurances, local regulatory expertise, and threat intelligence focused on the European threat landscape rather than generic global feeds. Gatewatcher's Trackwatch platform combines deep packet inspection technology with integrated threat intelligence—analyzing network traffic at the protocol level to detect advanced threats, malware command-and-control activity, and data exfiltration attempts while ensuring all data processing occurs within European infrastructure. The platform's threat intelligence integration focuses on threats relevant to European organizations: French-language phishing campaigns, European underground forum activity, threats targeting European critical infrastructure, and adversaries specifically focused on European targets. Gatewatcher's competitive advantage in the European market stems from local expertise, GDPR-compliant operations, and integration with European security ecosystems.
