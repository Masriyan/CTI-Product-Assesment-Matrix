# NSFOCUS CTI (China)

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** NSFOCUS Technologies Group Co., Ltd. (绿盟科技)
**Headquarters:** Beijing, China
**Founded:** 2000
**Website:** https://www.nsfocus.com.cn/

NSFOCUS emerged as one of China's pioneering cybersecurity companies when network security infrastructure in China was nascent, building expertise in carrier-grade DDoS mitigation and network threat detection before expanding into comprehensive threat intelligence. The company recognized that telecommunications carriers, internet service providers, and large Chinese enterprises faced massive-scale network attacks requiring intelligence beyond traditional signature-based defenses—particularly as China's internet infrastructure grew to become the world's largest. NSFOCUS' threat intelligence platform (NTI - NSFOCUS Threat Intelligence) combines the company's two-decade network security heritage with comprehensive threat intelligence: DDoS attack campaign tracking leveraging carrier-scale visibility, vulnerability intelligence aligned with Chinese national vulnerability databases, APT threat intelligence focused on attacks targeting Chinese organizations, and malware analysis of threats prevalent in the Chinese threat landscape. The platform's competitive advantage stems from NSFOCUS' massive deployment base across Chinese carriers, ISPs, and enterprises—providing network telemetry at internet-scale that enables early detection of attack campaigns, botnet infrastructure, and emerging threat patterns before they impact broader Chinese cyberspace. This carrier-grade perspective combined with compliance to Chinese cybersecurity regulations positions NSFOCUS as the dominant network security threat intelligence provider for China-based operations.
