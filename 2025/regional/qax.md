# Qi An Xin / QAX CTI (China)

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Qi An Xin Technology Group Inc. (奇安信科技集团)
**Headquarters:** Beijing, China
**Founded:** 2014 (spun out from Qihoo 360)
**Website:** https://www.qianxin.com/

Qi An Xin (QAX) emerged from China's consumer security giant Qihoo 360 to become one of China's largest enterprise cybersecurity companies, applying 360's massive threat telemetry and security research capabilities to government and enterprise threat intelligence. The company recognized that while consumer security provided broad threat visibility, Chinese government agencies, state-owned enterprises, and critical infrastructure required specialized threat intelligence addressing national-level cyber threats, APT campaigns targeting strategic sectors, and advanced persistent threats consistent with Chinese regulatory frameworks. QAX's Threat Intelligence Center (QTIC) leverages the company's comprehensive security product portfolio—endpoint protection, network security, cloud security—to provide holistic threat intelligence with particular strength in APT detection: tracking sophisticated threat actors targeting Chinese organizations, industrial control system (ICS/SCADA) threat intelligence for critical infrastructure, supply chain attack intelligence relevant to Chinese manufacturing and technology sectors, and compliance-aligned intelligence supporting China's Cybersecurity Law and Multi-Level Protection Scheme (MLPS) requirements. The platform's competitive advantage stems from QAX's position as a trusted security vendor for Chinese government and state-owned enterprises, providing early access to threat intelligence on attacks targeting strategic Chinese interests while maintaining data residency and regulatory compliance essential for government-grade deployment.
