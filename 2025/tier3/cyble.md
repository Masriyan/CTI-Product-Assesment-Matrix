# Cyble Vision

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Cyble Inc.
**Headquarters:** Atlanta, Georgia, USA / Alpharetta, Georgia
**Founded:** 2019
**Website:** https://cyble.com/

Cyble launched in 2019 with an ambitious mission: democratize threat intelligence by making comprehensive dark web monitoring, data breach detection, and ransomware intelligence accessible to organizations of all sizes at competitive prices. The company recognized that existing threat intelligence vendors served primarily large enterprises with six-figure budgets, leaving small and mid-market organizations exposed to the same sophisticated threats—ransomware gangs, credential theft operations, data breach ecosystems, and targeted cyber attacks—without access to actionable intelligence. Cyble's Vision platform leverages AI-powered automation to monitor thousands of underground sources including dark web forums, ransomware leak sites, Telegram channels, paste sites, and breach databases—detecting organization-specific threats and delivering high-priority alerts that enable immediate response. The platform gained rapid market recognition for its comprehensive ransomware intelligence: tracking dozens of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operations, monitoring leak sites where stolen data is posted to pressure victims, profiling ransomware affiliate networks, and providing early warning when organizations appear in pre-attack reconnaissance or post-compromise leak threats. Cyble's active threat research team publishes regular intelligence reports on emerging threats, vulnerability exploitation trends, and cybercrime ecosystem developments—establishing the company as a credible intelligence source beyond just providing a monitoring platform.
