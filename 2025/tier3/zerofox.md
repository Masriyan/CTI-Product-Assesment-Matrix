# ZeroFox Digital Risk Protection

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** ZeroFox, Inc.
**Headquarters:** Baltimore, Maryland, USA
**Founded:** 2013
**Website:** https://www.zerofox.com/

ZeroFox pioneered digital risk protection by recognizing that modern brands face cyber threats not just from network intrusions, but from social media impersonation, mobile app fraud, executive targeting, and phishing across digital channels where traditional security tools have no visibility. The platform's AI-powered DisrupTor engine monitors billions of social media posts, millions of mobile apps, dark web forums, and public cloud repositories to detect brand abuse, credential compromise, executive threats, and data leakage—automatically initiating takedown requests to remove malicious content within hours. ZeroFox's strength lies in automated remediation: beyond detection, the platform coordinates with social networks, app stores, domain registrars, and hosting providers to remove threats, protecting customer-facing brands from reputational damage and fraud.
