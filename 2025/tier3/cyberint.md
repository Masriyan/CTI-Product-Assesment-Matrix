# Cyberint Argos

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Cyberint Technologies Ltd.
**Headquarters:** Tel Aviv, Israel
**Founded:** 2010
**Website:** https://cyberint.com/

Cyberint entered the threat intelligence market during the early 2010s wave of Israeli cybersecurity innovation, bringing deep expertise from the nation's renowned intelligence and defense sectors to commercial external threat monitoring. The company recognized a critical gap: while organizations invested heavily in perimeter defenses and internal security controls, they remained blind to how threat actors were targeting them across the open, deep, and dark web—discussing planned attacks in underground forums, selling stolen credentials on marketplaces, launching phishing campaigns from lookalike domains, and researching corporate executives for social engineering attacks. Cyberint's Argos platform provides comprehensive external threat intelligence by continuously monitoring thousands of sources across the surface, deep, and dark web: cybercrime forums, underground marketplaces, paste sites, code repositories, social media, mobile app stores, and domain registration databases. The platform's automated monitoring detects organization-specific threats including credential leaks from stealer malware, corporate data exposure in breach databases, phishing domains targeting customers, executive information compiled for social engineering, brand impersonation on social media, and threat actor discussions about targeting specific industries or organizations. Cyberint combines automated intelligence collection with expert analyst support—providing managed service capabilities where threat intelligence analysts help customers interpret alerts, prioritize response actions, and implement remediation strategies.
