# CloudSEK XVigil

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** CloudSEK Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
**Headquarters:** Singapore / Bangalore, India
**Founded:** 2015
**Website:** https://cloudsek.com/

CloudSEK emerged from India's rapidly growing cybersecurity sector with a mission to democratize threat intelligence through AI-powered automation—making advanced external threat monitoring accessible to organizations across Asia-Pacific and beyond, without requiring large security teams or expensive analyst resources. The company recognized that traditional threat intelligence platforms were designed for Western markets and large enterprises, leaving mid-market organizations in APAC exposed to region-specific threats: Chinese-language underground forums, Southeast Asian cybercrime ecosystems, Indian financial fraud networks, and mobile-first attack vectors targeting the world's fastest-growing digital economies. CloudSEK's XVigil platform leverages artificial intelligence to monitor the surface, deep, and dark web for organization-specific threats—automatically translating content across multiple Asian languages, correlating disparate threat indicators, and prioritizing alerts based on business impact. The platform's comprehensive coverage includes data leak monitoring across paste sites and breach databases, brand protection across social media and e-commerce platforms, attack surface discovery for cloud and mobile assets, and ransomware intelligence tracking threat actor targeting discussions. CloudSEK's BeVigil mobile security offering provides specialized monitoring for mobile app security—detecting fake apps, malicious clones, and credential-stealing trojans across official and third-party app stores, addressing the mobile-first threat landscape in emerging markets.
