# Flare Threat Exposure Management

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Flare Systems Inc.
**Headquarters:** Montreal, Quebec, Canada
**Founded:** 2020
**Website:** https://flare.io/

Flare launched with a provocative value proposition: threat intelligence shouldn't require dedicated analysts, complex configurations, or enterprise budgets—any organization should be able to monitor for credential leaks, code exposure, and external threats with software that's as easy to use as Slack. The company recognized that traditional threat intelligence platforms were designed for Fortune 500 security operations centers with dedicated CTI analysts, leaving thousands of small and mid-market organizations without practical options for monitoring dark web threats, credential compromises, and sensitive data leaks. Flare's threat exposure management platform automates the entire external threat monitoring lifecycle: continuously scanning the clear web, dark web, code repositories, paste sites, and stealer log databases for organization-specific threats; automatically prioritizing alerts based on business impact; and delivering actionable notifications directly to security teams via Slack, Microsoft Teams, or email—eliminating the need for users to log into yet another security dashboard. The platform's core strength is simplicity: organizations can deploy Flare in minutes by specifying domains, employee email patterns, and sensitive keywords—the platform handles discovery, monitoring, alerting, and prioritization automatically. Flare's competitive pricing and self-service model target the underserved small business and lower mid-market segments where security teams of 1-10 people need automated threat monitoring without analyst overhead.
