# Searchlight Cyber DarkIQ™

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Searchlight Cyber Ltd.
**Headquarters:** Portsmouth, United Kingdom
**Founded:** 2017
**Website:** https://www.searchlight.ai/

Searchlight Cyber emerged from the UK's law enforcement and intelligence community with deep expertise in dark web investigations, threat actor profiling, and underground marketplace operations—bringing specialized tradecraft developed for criminal investigations to commercial threat intelligence. The company's founders recognized that while many vendors claimed dark web monitoring capabilities, few possessed the investigative expertise, linguistic capabilities, and operational security practices needed to maintain persistent access to restricted underground forums, encrypted messaging platforms, and invite-only marketplaces where sophisticated threat actors operate. Searchlight's DarkIQ™ platform provides organizations with intelligence-grade dark web monitoring by combining proprietary collection infrastructure, expert analyst teams, and automated alerting systems to detect organization-specific threats emerging from underground ecosystems. The platform monitors hundreds of dark web forums, cybercrime marketplaces, ransomware leak sites, Telegram channels, Discord servers, and paste sites—translating technical underground discussions into actionable corporate security intelligence. Searchlight's competitive advantage lies in its specialized focus: rather than attempting to build a comprehensive threat intelligence platform competing with established vendors, the company concentrates on providing best-in-class dark web and underground intelligence that complements existing security operations—serving organizations that require deep expertise in adversary intelligence, ransomware tracking, and cybercrime ecosystem monitoring.
