# Brandefense Digital Asset Protection Platform (DAPP)

## 📋 Overview

**Vendor:** Brandefense Inc.
**Headquarters:** Istanbul, Turkey / Delaware, USA
**Founded:** 2017
**Website:** https://www.brandefense.com/

Brandefense emerged from Turkey's growing cybersecurity sector to address a critical gap in digital risk protection: organizations lacked comprehensive visibility into their external attack surface and how cybercriminals were targeting their digital assets across the entire internet landscape. The company recognized that modern threats originate beyond traditional network perimeters—attackers scan external assets for vulnerabilities, purchase credentials on dark web marketplaces, impersonate brands to defraud customers, and exploit misconfigurations in cloud infrastructure that organizations don't even know exists. Brandefense's Digital Asset Protection Platform (DAPP) automatically discovers an organization's complete external-facing attack surface including domains, subdomains, IP addresses, cloud assets, SSL certificates, exposed services, and mobile applications—then continuously monitors these assets for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, data leaks, brand abuse, and active targeting by threat actors. The platform's dark web monitoring tracks 800+ underground forums, marketplaces, and paste sites for organization-specific threats: leaked credentials, corporate data for sale, ransomware targeting discussions, and brand impersonation campaigns. Brandefense's competitive advantage lies in its comprehensive approach that unifies attack surface management, dark web intelligence, and brand protection into a single platform—enabling security teams to discover unknown assets, identify exposures, and detect external threats without managing multiple specialized tools.
